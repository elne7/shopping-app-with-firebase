# localization_perform

Considering my last project the `Simple Shopping App`, This Task is a complement for the previous project.
You can see the shopping app from here: [https://github.com/elne7/Simple-Shopping-App.git]

**Features:**

- Displays the app in English and can change it to Arabic.
- Adding `Drawer` for side options in the home page.

**Dependencies:**

- Uses the `EasyLocalization` package to localise the app.
